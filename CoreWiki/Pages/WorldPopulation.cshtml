<h2>World population</h2>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

<p>
    World population has experienced since the end of the Great Famine of 1315–17 and the Black Death in 1350, 
    when it was near 370 million. The highest population growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% 
    per year – occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking to 2.06% between 1965 and 1970.[3] 
    The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century.

<h2>Population by region</h2>
<p>
    Six of the Earth's seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale.
    Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting
    for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries, China
    and India, together constitute about 36% of the world's population. Africa is the
    second most populated continent, with around 1.28 billion people, or 16% of the
    world's population. Europe's 742 million people make up 10% of the world's population
    as of 2018, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651
    million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada,
    has a population of around 363 million (5%), and Oceania, the least populated region,
    has about 41 million inhabitants (0.5%). Though it is not permanently inhabited by
    any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population
    based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer
    months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their
    home countries.
